How do I get homework/assignments, tests, etc.?

To complete test assignments and exams on Educify, follow these general steps:

Log In: Sign in to your Educify account using your username and password.

Navigate to Your Course/Classes: Locate the course for which you have a test assignment or exam. This might be on your dashboard or in a "My Courses" section.

Access the Test/Exam: Look for a section related to assessments, tests, or exams within the course. This could be labeled as "Assessments," "Quizzes," or something similar.

Review Instructions: Before starting the test, carefully read any instructions provided by the instructor. Ensure you understand the format, time limit, and any specific guidelines.

Start the Test: Begin the test according to the provided instructions. You might encounter different question types, such as multiple-choice, short answer, or essay questions. We use the notes and Homework features for setting tests and for assessments. All these features will be collapsed into the "Workspace".

Submit Your Responses: After completing the test, follow the platform's instructions to submit your responses. Some tests may require you to submit each question individually, while others may allow you to submit all responses at once.

Review Feedback (if applicable): After the test is graded (if applicable), you may have access to feedback provided by the instructor. This can be valuable for understanding your performance and improving in future assessments.

Remember that the specific steps and features can vary based on the Educify platform and the course design. If you encounter any difficulties or have specific questions about completing tests on Educify, consider reaching out to the instructor or the platform's support team for assistance.
