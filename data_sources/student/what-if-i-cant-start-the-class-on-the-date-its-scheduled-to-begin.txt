What if I can’t start the class on the date it’s scheduled to begin?

If you miss a scheduled class on Educify, here are some general steps you can take:

Check for Recorded Sessions: Many online courses, especially asynchronous ones, provide recorded sessions or lectures. Check if the missed class was recorded and if you can access the recording to catch up on the content.

Review Class Materials: Even if there isn't a recording, review any class materials, slides, or notes that were shared. This can help you understand the key points covered during the missed session.

Check Announcements: Instructors often use announcements or discussion forums to communicate important information. Check for any announcements related to the missed class, such as additional resources or instructions.

Reach Out to Instructor: If you have questions or need clarification on the content covered, consider reaching out to your instructor. Instructors may provide additional support or resources to help you catch up.

Connect with Peers: If there is a discussion forum or group for your class, consider reaching out to classmates to get their perspectives on what was covered. Peer collaboration can be valuable in catching up on missed content.

Review Syllabus: The class syllabus may provide an overview of the topics covered during each session. Use it as a reference to ensure you cover the necessary material.

Check for Make-Up Opportunities: Some instructors may offer make-up opportunities or additional resources for students who miss a class. Look for information about make-up sessions or alternative assignments.

Classes can be rescheduled from the class options in the teacher Dashboard. You can message him or her in the messaging option.

Remember that proactive communication and staying informed are key. If you know in advance that you'll miss a class, consider informing your instructor and checking if there are any specific arrangements or resources provided for such situations. Each course and instructor may have different policies, so it's beneficial to be aware of the expectations for missed classes in your specific course.
