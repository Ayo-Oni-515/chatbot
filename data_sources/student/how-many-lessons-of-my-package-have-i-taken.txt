How many Lessons of  my package have I taken?

You can see the number of lessons you have taken under the "My Lessons" menu option on your dashboard. Once a lesson is finished, the teacher must set the lesson to Finished. You can find the number of lessons you have taken and what is left under "My Lessons' option.

To check the lessons you have completed on Educify, follow these general steps:

Log In: Sign in to your Educify account using your username and password.

Navigate to Your Course: Locate the specific course for which you want to check completed lessons. This might be on your dashboard or in a "My Courses" section.

Check Progress or Completion Tracker: Look for a progress tracker, completion status, or a similar feature within the course interface. This might be on the dashboard or in the course details section.

Review Graded Assignments: Completed lessons may be associated with graded assignments. Check the assignments section to see which ones you have submitted and received grades for.

Check for Marked Completion: Some platforms mark lessons or modules as completed once you've gone through the content. Look for indicators such as checkmarks, completion badges, or progress bars.

Consult Course Syllabus:** The course syllabus or outline may also provide information about completed lessons and the overall progress in the course

Contact Instructor or Support:** If you have difficulty finding information about completed lessons, consider reaching out to your course instructor or Educify's support team for assistance.

Keep in mind that the specific features and user interface can vary across online learning platforms, and Educify might have updates or changes after my last knowledge update in January 2022. If you're unable to find information through the platform's interface, the instructor or support team can guide you on how to track your lesson completion.
