Dropping" a class means you dropped it before the end of the drop/add period. A student "withdraws" from a course/lesson after the end of the drop/add period. Credit hours for dropped courses are not included in your hours of enrolment .

Check your teacher's deadline for withdrawal. The deadline to withdraw is typically set three quarters of the way through the semester For a full semester, 12-week class, the withdrawal deadline will be around week eight. If the deadline has passed, you will have to stick with the class and receive a letter grade. Check your school's website or administrative offices for the official deadline.

Log into your student account and go to the class registration area. Look for an “add/drop” tab. You'll see a list of your classes. Click on the “withdraw” option in the drop-down box. You also have the option of unsubscribing from the lesson in your student dashboard.
