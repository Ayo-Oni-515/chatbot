Localized Methods (for global users): Solutions like Mercado Pago (Latin America), GCash (Philippines), or Paymentwall (which adapts payment options per country) help support regional preferences.

2. Benefits of Offering Multiple Payment Methods
Providing a variety of payment options enhances:

Convenience & Accessibility: Caters to users globally with different preferences and regional norms

User Experience: Digital wallets significantly reduce checkout friction—some sites report up to a 20% increase in completed transactions.

Security: Payment processors employ encryption, tokenization, and fraud prevention tools to protect financial data.

3. How we Integrate or Use These Methods
Transactions are handled via secure Payment Service Providers (PSPs) or gateways such as Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, or Paymentwall for broad coverage, including multicurrency and fraud protection.

Payment details are never stored on our servers—they are transmitted directly to the payment processor to maintain compliance with security standards .
