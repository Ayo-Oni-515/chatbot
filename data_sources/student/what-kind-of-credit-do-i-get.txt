What kind of credit do I get?

Educify primarily offers online courses and learning resources, and the type of credit you receive can depend on the specific course or program you enrol in. Here are some possibilities:

Certificates of Completion: Many courses on Educify provide certificates of completion. These certificates acknowledge that you have successfully completed the course but may not carry formal academic credit.

Professional Development Credits: Some courses may offer professional development credits or Continuing Education Units (CEUs), which are often used for professional growth but may not be academic credits.

Academic Credits: In some cases, courses on Educify might be affiliated with universities or educational institutions, offering academic credits that can be transferable to degree programs. However, this is less common on online learning platforms like Educify.

No Credit: Many courses on Educify are designed for skill development and knowledge acquisition without offering formal academic credits.

To determine the type of credit associated with a specific course on Educify, you should:

*Check the course description and details on the Educify platform.

*Look for information about certificates, CEUs, or academic credit.

*Contact the Educify support team or the instructor for specific details about the credit offered in a particular course.

*Keep in mind that course offerings and credit options can change, so it's advisable to verify this information directly on the Educify platform for the most up-to-date details.
