How soon can I start my lessons?
How soon can I start my lessons?

This question is easy to answer as you chose your lesson timing yourself and got a notification of lesson approval when the teacher approved your lessons.  The first lesson is typically scheduled between 24-72 hours from the time you booked it. You can also check your message centre, to be aware of the conversations with your assigned teacher. Do well to also check your emails and sms to be aware of all conversations.

You can find the start date and time of your lesson on your payment receipt and your lesson reminder, in your student dashboard, and so many other options.
