What is a "Pay as you go" lesson Schedule?

We sometimes offer "pay as you go" lesson schedules, but these are the most expensive options. They do not come with the savings and discounts that come with the packages and the fixed schedules. 

Once you purchase a package, you can ask your teacher for flexible scheduling, which is available through your student's dashboard. 

NB: This is not the same as "Schedule as you go" lesson package.

Pay-as-you-go is a system in which a person or organization pays for the costs of something when they occur rather than before or afterward.It's flexible, as you aren't tied to any long-term contract or commitment. Instead, you pay upfront for credit or a set amount of minutes, texts and data, and you can top this up once you've used up your allowances
