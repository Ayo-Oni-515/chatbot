What does recurring lesson mean?

Recurring lesson subscription system is a way of reserving a space with your teacher after an initial "Trial" session. This means that you will be able to reserve a fixed time with your teacher and you can have that time without losing the spot. It also means that you can reserve the pricing you have got.

A recurring lesson schedule means you have a specific day and time reserved with your teacher for your lessons, and that the lesson is set up to repeat. Having a recurring lesson schedule ensures no one else can take your spot unless you cancel your lessons.

A Recurring schedule is used for an event that takes places on a regular basis (Example: every Monday and Wednesday from October through December). These events will also be in the same location/room at the same time of day.

When you select the option for lessons to repeat, you've selected to put your student on a Recurring Schedule. That means you and your student will meet consistently at the same time each week (or every other week, every 3 weeks, etc). You can set the number of weeks between lessons and the day and time of the lesson when you add or edit your student's lessons on your calendar. You can even schedule multiple recurring lessons during the week (e.g. tutoring on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week).

Setting up a Recurring Schedule for your student is a great way to save time because lessons automatically repeat on your calendar. It ensures that your student's time slot remains blocked off in your availability and helps avoid scheduling conflicts.
