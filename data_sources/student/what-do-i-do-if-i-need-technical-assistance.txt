What do I do if I need technical assistance?
Getting technical assistance is easier that think. There are two options in the student dashboard: 1) FAQ, and 2) Help and Support menu options.

1) FAQ: Think of our FAQ section as a mini-help section. With the FAQ, you can find answers to curious questions easily and quickly. If you need more detailed answers or need to send an email or mail an inquiry in real time, our Help and Support page is the way to go.

2) Help and support: This is the detailed help sub-domain for all your help issues.  You can send us an email, call our support team, or chat with our agent or chatbot. In addition, you will find a lot of help articles that can be of tremendous assistance on virtually any topic. You can also submit a request for new issues that you find and we have not provided.
