Can I take Lessons with more than one Teacher?

Yes, you can take lessons from more than one teacher. We designed educify.org to put your needs first as a customer. You can go to your profile and look for lessons so you can try out other teachers. Please take note that you can only have the privilege of one FREE lesson on our platform. Meaning that all subsequent trial lessons must be paid for at very low prices, of course.
If you can not find a suitable teacher, you can give us a call on +1888 252 9485 or email us at support@educify.org

To be able to take two or more teachers you can also check out for the 'my lessons ' tag on the dashboard and there you'll find all the teachers you need based on the course you are choosing and then you are privileged to have more than one by just accepting their lesson details and conditions
