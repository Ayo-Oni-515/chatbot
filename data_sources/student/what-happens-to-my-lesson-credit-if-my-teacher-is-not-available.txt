What happens to my Lesson credit if my teacher is not available?

We have thousands of teachers on educify.org and all our teachers have undergone thorough screening. We always take notice of those lessons that have not been approved by the teachers, and we would make every effort to contact you about a possible substitute or replacement and even offer you a trial with him or her.

If your teacher is not available or absent, the impact on your lesson credit will depend on various factors, including the policies of the educational institution, the specific course, and the platform (such as Educify) where you are taking the lesson. Here are some possible scenarios:

Rescheduled Lesson: In some cases, if a teacher is unable to conduct a lesson, it may be rescheduled for a later date. This could depend on the availability of the teacher and the preferences of the students.

Substitute Teacher: Depending on the circumstances, a substitute teacher may take over the lesson. This is more common in traditional classroom settings but may occur in online platforms as well.

Recorded Content: Some courses provide recorded lectures or lesson materials that you can access even if the live session is missed. This allows you to catch up on the content at your convenience.

Communication from Instructor: Your instructor or the course facilitator may communicate alternative arrangements or provide guidance on how missed lessons will be handled.

Refund or Credit: In some cases, if a significant portion of the course is affected by the teacher's absence, the educational institution or platform may offer a refund or credit for the affected lessons.

It's essential to review the course policies and guidelines provided by the platform or educational institution. If your teacher is not around and you're uncertain about the impact on your lesson credit, consider reaching out to the course instructor, the platform's support team, or referring to the course documentation for clarification.
