What happens if I don’t finish the course?

If you don’t complete an online course on Educify, what happens depends on the type of course and its policies:

Access to Course Materials:

Many courses allow you to keep accessing the materials even if you don’t finish them right away.

Some courses may have a time limit or expiration date, after which access may be restricted.

Certification or Accreditation:

If the course offers a certificate or accreditation, you won’t receive it unless you complete all required lessons and assessments.

Next Steps:

Always check the course details or terms on Educify before enrolling.

If you have questions about an incomplete course, reach out to Educify support to see what options are available.
