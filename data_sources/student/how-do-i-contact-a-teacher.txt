How do I contact a teacher?

There are many ways to contact a teacher on our platform: 

Message first and ask questions before booking
Through the "Ask Question" option on the teacher profile, where you can make inquiries about the lessons and the options that the teacher offers before making a booking.

Message through the message centre of the student portal

You can message your assigned teacher only after payment and after scheduling a paid lesson through the "My Messages" section of your student portal.
