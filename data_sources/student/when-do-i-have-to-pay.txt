When do I have to pay?

If you're referring to "Educify," the payment details, including when and how to pay, can vary based on the specific course you're interested in. Here are general steps to understand when you may need to pay:

To make payment, you have to first book a lesson through the teacher profile. We also have subscription feature which you can see from the teacher checkout pages and in your dashboard.

Explore Courses/Classes: Visit the Educify platform and browse through the available courses.

Course Details: Click on the specific course you're interested in to access more details.

Enrollment Information: Look for information about any associated costs or fees. Some courses may be free, while others might have a fee for enrollment.

Payment Process: If the course has a fee, you'll likely encounter a payment process during the enrollment phase. This may involve providing payment details and completing the transaction.

Payment Confirmation: After successful payment, you should receive confirmation of your enrollment, and you'll likely gain access to the course materials.

If you have specific questions about payment or if the information isn't clear, you can contact Educify's support team or check their help resources for more guidance. Always review the course details and payment information before finalizing enrollment.
