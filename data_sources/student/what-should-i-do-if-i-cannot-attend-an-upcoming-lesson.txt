First and most importantly, cancellation policy on educify is at least 18 hours ahead of the lessons. Note that you will be sent reminder email and sms 24 hrs and 1 hr before the lesson. Remember to ask you teacher to reschedule your class.

If you can not attend an upcoming lesson, you need to remember to request a reschedule of the lesson and make sure the lesson is cancelled and rebooked for you. Our terms of service state that you need to give at least 24 hours notice before any cancellation can be granted. In a case beyond your control, you must give at least 6 hours notice for a reschedule or cancellation to be entertained.

If you can't attend a scheduled class on Educify, here are steps you can consider:

Check for Recording: Many online classes are recorded. Check if the platform provides recordings of the sessions, allowing you to catch up later.

Inform Instructor: If possible, inform your instructor in advance about your inability to attend. They might provide guidance or share relevant materials with you.

Review Course Materials:** Even if you can't attend a live session, review any materials, slides, or notes shared by the instructor. This can help you stay updated on the content.

Check for Make-Up Opportunities:** In some cases, instructors may offer make-up sessions or alternative ways for you to cover the material missed during the scheduled class.

Collaborate with Peers:** If there are discussion forums or collaborative elements in the course, reach out to classmates for notes or insights from the missed session.

Follow-Up Questions:** If you have questions about the content covered during the missed class, consider reaching out to the instructor for clarification.

Respect Deadlines:** If the missed class affects assignments or assessments, ensure that you're aware of any deadlines and make arrangements accordingly.

Remember that communication is key. If you anticipate missing a class, try to inform your instructor in advance and seek guidance on how to stay updated. Each course and instructor may have specific policies and procedures for handling missed sessions.
