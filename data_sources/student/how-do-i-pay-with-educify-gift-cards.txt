How do I pay with Educify Gift cards?
We have several levels of Gift cards, and each gift card carries an amount that can be redeemed through your student portal/profile. All gift cards can be used to pay for lessons using their coupon codes. You can equally use your coupon codes to redeem discounts and pay for part of a lesson with a teacher.  remember to enter your gift card code or your coupon code at checkout.
