How do I put Lesson on hold?( I am taking a break).

This is also known as "Taking a break". If you plan to put your lesson on hold, please notify your teacher and he/she would notify the admin and they can also end your subscription in the teacher dashboard.

online learning platforms, including Educify, typically do not have a feature specifically designed for putting a lesson on hold. However, if you need to pause your participation in a course or temporarily stop engaging with certain lessons, you can consider the following general steps:

Contact Instructor: Reach out to your course instructor or facilitator to explain your situation. Instructors are often understanding of students' circumstances and may provide guidance on how to manage your learning plan.

Review Course Policies:** Check the course policies or syllabus for any guidelines related to temporary breaks or pauses. Some courses may have specific provisions for accommodating students who need to put their learning on hold.

Manage Your Time:** If possible, plan your schedule to accommodate any unexpected disruptions or periods when you might need to reduce your involvement in the course temporarily.

Communicate in Advance:** If you anticipate needing to put lessons on hold due to personal or scheduling reasons, it's beneficial to communicate with your instructor in advance. This allows for better planning and understanding.

Explore Self-Paced Options:** If the course is self-paced, you might have the flexibility to revisit lessons at your convenience. Check if the platform allows you to progress through the course at your own pace.

Check for Recorded Content:** Review whether the platform provides recorded lectures or sessions. This can be useful if you need to catch up on missed content later.

Understand Consequences:** Be aware of any potential consequences or implications of putting lessons on hold. This could include missing deadlines or falling behind on assignments.

Always refer to the specific policies and guidelines provided by the Educify platform and your course instructor for the most accurate and up-to-date information. If there have been updates or changes to Educify's features since my last knowledge update, consult the platform's official documentation or contact their support for guidance.
