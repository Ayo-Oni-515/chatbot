How do I Change my email address?

There is no way of changing your email address at the moment. We are working hard to improve this process.

As you can see from the "Account Setting" Page, there is no way of adding or changing your email address at the moment. The workaround is to delete the current account and register again. You can send an email to onboarding@educify.org to help delete the account with wrong email address.
