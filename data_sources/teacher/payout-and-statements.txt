How Tutor Payouts Work
Monthly Payout Cycle
Tutors are paid on a monthly basis, with payouts scheduled within the first week of the following month—providing clear expectations and consistency.

Minimum Earning Threshold
Payouts are processed when your earnings exceed $30, similar to industry norms where minimum thresholds ensure efficient processing .

Secure Payment Methods
Payments are issued via trusted third-party processors such as PayPal, Stripe, Payoneer, or bank transfer. The exact method used will be the one you've selected in your account, and details must be accurate to ensure smooth delivery.

How to Access Your Payment Statements
