Having Issues Receiving Payments?
We want to ensure your experience is smooth and stress-free. If you’re facing issues with receiving your payments, here’s a breakdown tailored just for Educify platform users:

1. Double-Check Your Payment Details
Go to your dashboard and verify that the payout method (PayPal or bank transfer) is correctly entered and up to date.

Make sure the PayPal email or bank account information has no typos and remains valid.

2. Account Verification Matters
For PayPal transfers, ensure your account is confirmed and has no limitations preventing incoming funds.

Some banks may flag transfers if verification is incomplete, so make sure your account is fully verified.

3. Processing Delays Are Common
Funds may show as “sent” on Educify but may take 2–5 business days to appear in your account due to processing timelines.

4. Returned or Blocked Payments
If a payment was returned (e.g., due to incorrect details), update your payout information and contact support to request a resend.

Occasionally, third-party processors may block transfers—check for notifications or contact PayPal/bank support if needed.

5. Keep Communication with Support
If you haven’t received your payment after 3 business days, submit a support ticket with:

The date the payout was initiated

Payment method used

Any transaction or reference number you may have

A short summary of the issue

We’re here to resolve issues and support you every step of the way.

Example: Real Tutor Experiences
