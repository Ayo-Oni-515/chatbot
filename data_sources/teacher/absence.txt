Absence
ABSENCE

We require 24 hours notice of cancellation from students and the system will notify the teacher in their inbox immediately the request is received in the application. By doing this, we are also giving advance notice of absences or cancellations to the affected teacher.

In the event the student fails to notify us of a cancellation, the fee for that class will be charged and your payment will be made to the teacher as at when due.
