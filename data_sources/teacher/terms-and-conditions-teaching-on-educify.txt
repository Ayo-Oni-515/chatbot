Terms and Conditions - Teaching on Educify

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR: Please note that your relationship with Educify is governed by a contractual agreement. Under this contract, both the company and you (the independent contractor) are compensated based on the number of lessons you conduct. This payment structure emphasizes the importance of your role and the value of each lesson provided. It is essential to adhere to the agreed-upon schedule and maintain the highest standards of teaching to ensure mutual success and fulfillment of the contractual terms. 

PUNCTUALITY: Teachers are expected to be fully aware of their lesson schedules and plan their activities accordingly. Arriving late or failing to attend scheduled classes is deemed highly unprofessional and is not acceptable. 

ABSENCE: We require 24 hours notice of cancellation from students and the system will notify the teacher in their inbox immediately the request is received in the application. By doing this, we are also giving advance notice of absences or cancellations to the affected teacher.
In the event the student fails to notify us of a cancellation, the fee for that class will be charged and your payment will be made to the teacher as at when due.
Teachers are also expected to inform us at least 12 hours before the commencement of a class.

OUR STUDENTS: Any student assigned to you remains our student and all communication with them must cease when you leave the company. It is expected that during your employment with Educify Inc. and for a period of  three months following your departure from our employment, regardless of the reason for your departure, you will not directly or indirectly solicit, attempt to solicit, or assist in soliciting any students who are currently enrolled or have been enrolled in Educify Incâ€™s programs within the last [three months] for the purpose of enrolling them in any other educational programs or institutions. 
Any act or behavior that can be construed as POACHING of students could result in immediate termination and further actions. Poaching of students can be described as soliciting for students on the platform for training delivery outside the platform without the knowledge or written approval of Educify.
RESIGNATION: To ensure a smooth transition and adequate time for us to find a suitable replacement, teachers are required to provide at least 15 days' notice prior to their resignation.
Procedure for Resignation Notification:
Resignations must be officially communicated via email.
The resignation email should be sent to: hr@educify.org
Important Note:
Any staff member who fails to provide proper notice of resignation, and is deemed to have abandoned their position, will have their outstanding payments withheld.
