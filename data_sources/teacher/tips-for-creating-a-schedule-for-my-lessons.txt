Tips for creating a schedule for my lessons
Creating a schedule for your lessons involves thoughtful planning to ensure effectiveness and accessibility. Here are three steps to guide you:

Understand Your Audience:

▪️ Identify the demographics and time zone preferences of your students.
▪️ Consider their daily routines, such as school or work hours, to determine when they are likely to be available.
▪️ If possible, conduct surveys or gather feedback to understand the preferred time frames of your audience.

Establish Consistent Time Slots:

▪️ Choose specific time slots for your lessons that align with the availability of your target audience.
▪️ Aim for consistency in your schedule to help students plan their learning routine.
▪️ Consider providing options for different time zones if you have a diverse group of students.

Balance Live and Recorded Sessions:

▪️ Offer a mix of live sessions and recorded content to accommodate varying schedules.
▪ Live sessions provide real-time interaction, while recorded sessions allow flexibility for students who cannot attend live.
▪️ Clearly communicate the schedule, including live session times and when recorded content will be available.
