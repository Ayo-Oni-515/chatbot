Here’s a revised version of your Help & Support content, updated to reflect that administrators determine lesson pricing, and teachers should coordinate with the support team—presented in a clear, user-friendly style:

How Do I Set the Price for My Lessons?
While tutors play a key role in designing lesson content, Educify’s support team oversees lesson pricing to ensure fairness and consistency across the platform.

Setting Lesson Rates: Process Overview
Submit Your Pricing Proposal

Once you’ve created or selected your lesson schedule, submit your recommended rate via your tutor dashboard or reach out to the support team directly.

Consult & Confirm

A member of Educify Support will review your proposed rate. If adjustments are needed—based on market benchmarks, platform guidelines, or consistency—someone from the team will reach out to discuss the details.

Final Approval

Once approved, Educify will publish the price on your profile so students can view and book lessons at that rate.
