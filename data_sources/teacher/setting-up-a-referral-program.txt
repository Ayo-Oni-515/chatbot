Setting up a referral program
1. Define Your Goals
Decide what you want the referral program to achieve:

Attract new students

Reward loyal students

Boost lesson package sales

2. Choose Rewards
For the Referrer (existing student):

Discount on next lesson (e.g., 10–20%)

Free trial lesson after X referrals

Credits toward a lesson package

For the Referral (new student):

Discount on first lesson (e.g., 20%)

Free trial lesson

Welcome bonus package (e.g., 5 lessons, get 1 free)

3. Set Up Program Rules
Each referral must be a new student who completes at least one lesson.

Limit the number of rewards per month to prevent abuse, or make it scalable (e.g., “up to 5 referrals per month”).

Decide if the discount/credit expires after a certain time.

4. Implement on Educify Platform
Referral Links or Codes: Give each student a unique code or referral link.

Tracking: Automatically track when a new student signs up using a referral link or code.

Automated Notifications: Notify both parties when a referral is successful and reward is applied.

5. Promote the Program
Highlight the referral program in the dashboard, email newsletters, and social media.

Use banners like:

“Invite a Friend, Get 1 Free Lesson!”

“Your Friend Saves 20%, You Save 10%!”

6. Monitor & Optimize
Track metrics: number of referrals, new sign-ups, and lessons booked.

Adjust rewards or rules if participation is low or costs are too high.
