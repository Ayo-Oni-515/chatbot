What if I want to change the duration of my students' lessons?

Modify lesson duration through your scheduling or "Manage Subjects" section in your profile. Changes will be reflected in the student's dashboard, and notifications will be sent accordingly. 

The only options available right now is through the "reschedule" option. You can reschedule the lessons and choose the duration of the lessons. See the image below

As you can see in the image below, you can choose the lesson duration after you have picked the lesson duration.
