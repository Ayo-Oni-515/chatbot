Can I report or contact a student guardian/parent?

Yes, as a teacher, you can contact a student's guardian or parent to discuss their lessons, progress, or any concerns you may have, but prior permission from Educify needs to be given. 

It's a common practice to maintain open communication between educators and parents to support the student's academic success. that is why we have created the chat feature of the platform where you can communicate with your students and/or their parents or guardians.
