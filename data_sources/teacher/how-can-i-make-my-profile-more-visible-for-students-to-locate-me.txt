How can I make my profile more visible for students to locate me?

Here are tips on creating a well-crafted online teacher profile or improving the one you have.

Choose a good profile picture
The first impression you give students and parents starts with the profile picture.

Professional, friendly photo with a smile, appropriate attire, neutral background, face from shoulder up, current.

Write a strong bio

Concise teacher bio: 3 paragraphs, easy-to-read format. Include relevant info like certification, brief teaching experience, and strengths. Use simple language, avoid slang and technical terms. Add creativity and humor. Warm, conversational tone. Mention hobbies. Summarize qualifications and experience, focus on key details.

Add a self-introduction video
Essential 1-3 min intro video: Highlight qualifications, build rapport. Record in quiet, well-lit place. Speak clearly, avoid reading script. Smile, be confident.

Add your Qualification/Education
Although students, parents, and employers can learn the most important information about you from your freelance teacher profile description, some of them may still require your resume.

Clean, reader-friendly resume: Use easy fonts, max two colours. Organize in bulleted lists. Avoid abbreviations, jargon, and flowery language.

Mention other relevant services you offer
Feel free to mention any expertise you have in other areas related to the English language, like translating, copywriting, or blog writing. Who knows, a student might just be looking for an English teacher who can also do translation work!

Adding reviews of the students you’ve taught in the past not only adds to your credibility as a teacher but also gives potential clients an idea about the quality of your work.
Marketplace: Students review on platform. Independent: Ask for reviews on Facebook, Yelp, website. Add links or excerpts to teacher profile.

Contact information
Finally, be sure that interested students can contact you easily. Provide clickable links to your email address, website, and work phone number (if possible) on your teacher profile, and make them visible by putting them at the top.  This way, your clients don’t have to scroll through a long page or spend time looking for your contact details if they decide to take classes with you.
