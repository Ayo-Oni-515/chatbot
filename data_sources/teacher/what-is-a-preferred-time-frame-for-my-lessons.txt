What is a preferred time frame for my lessons?
The preferred time frame for your lessons on Educify largely depends on your target audience's availability and preferences.

 Consider factors such as:

Student Schedule: Align your lessons with times when your target students are generally available. Evenings and weekends are often popular choices, but it may vary based on age groups and geographical locations.

Time Zone Considerations: If you have a diverse student base, be mindful of time zone differences. Choose time slots that are reasonable for a broad range of locations if possible.

Survey Your Audience: Conduct a survey or ask for feedback from your existing or potential students. This can provide insights into their preferred time frames and help you tailor your schedule accordingly.

Flexibility: Offer some flexibility in your schedule to accommodate students with various commitments. Consider providing both live sessions and recorded content for those who may have different time constraints.

Consistency: Once you establish a schedule, try to maintain consistency. This helps students plan their study routines and ensures a reliable learning experience.
