What about Background Check?

You will need a vulnerable sector  and criminal check to be able to teach in-person (Student Place and Teacher's Place/Studio) on our platform. If you do not have a valid criminal and vulnerable sector check, you can get them through our platform using either "mybackcheck" link or through "Yardstik". Come back after getting them and finish your profile, your progress should be saved.

In addition, you need to add your location to the website if you are going to teach in-person.
