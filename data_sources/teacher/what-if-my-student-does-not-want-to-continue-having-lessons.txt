What if my student does not want to continue having lessons?
How do I cancel a lesson?

Ask Them if this is a break
Clarify with the student if the request is for a break or indefinite cancellation. The cancellation will be effective from the next billing cycle. Upcoming updates on educify.org will introduce new recurring and cancellation features.

If they want to stop lessons indefinitely or entirely
To terminate or suspend lessons, remove the student from your roster. Ensure they are also removed from the recurring charges option under your roster. You can tell them to unsubscribe from the lesson.
