What of rescheduling future Lessons?

The same way you schedule lessons ordinarily, you can reschedule future lessons with flexibility by EDITING YOUR AVAILABILITYFOR THAT LESSON . To do this ;

1. Go the "My listings" section

2. Select the "Manage availability" box

3. Select the day and time you want to reschedule. Taking a case study; I'm trying to reschedule lessons I will be having on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and the time I won't be available as 00:30 - 01:00 on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 00:15 - 00:30 on Friday.

4. You just have to click the orange boxes in the "blue rectangle" . You should have this after clicking the three boxes; the three boxes "un-highlighted"

Please note that; Deactivating or rescheduling a lesson will be effected on every other lesson. 

Also, you will have to inform the students that you will be having this lesson with on the reschedule. 

This is only available for Future lessons and not for past lessons. Some exceptions are if the teacher was not available to take the lessons and would want to do that at a future date.

This feature is available for both Private and Group lessons options. You can edit recurring lesson series.
