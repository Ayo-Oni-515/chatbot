How to select my timezone

All you need to do in selecting or changing your time zone, just these simple steps: 

1. Go to "my lessons" and click on it.

2. You'll find a time zone space there but written there is an example: time zone "Africa".

3. Click on it so as to select your own time zone.

By clicking the button indicated as Africa/Lagos, you can change the time zone of displayed time to your preferred timezone.

With the help of the timezone select button, students are able to select their various timezones if not equivalent to that of the teacher.  Students are to carefully check for the time decisions of their teachers, and also the timezone of that particular teacher so as to create conveniences for both parties since students don't have the liberty of speculating their time. If then the teacher selected has an inconvenient time choice to the students, students can look out for other teachers or rather still send a message to the teacher inorder to rehearse or bargain on a more convenient time for both parties.

There is always room for changing your timezone and lesson hours if there are any inconveniences or a geographical migration. But all decisions on time changing must be discussed with your teacher, and you can also paste it to the admin.
