How do I know which lessons are coming up?

When you schedule a lesson either through our website or through your student dashboard, you get a receipt of your payment as well as a confirmation of the lesson packages. You will now get both SMS and email reminders of upcoming lessons. Please be on the lookout for SMS and emails and ensure you have the right email and phone number on your profile. You can edit your phone number and email address through your profile and your student dashboard.

NB: Reminders are scheduled to come every 1 day and 1 hour before the upcoming lesson. If you do not receive sms and/or email reminders, please reach out to our support department at support@educify.org

To find information about upcoming lessons on Educify, you can follow these general steps:

Log In: Sign in to your Educify account using your username and password.

Navigate to Your Class: Locate the specific course for which you want information about upcoming lessons. This might be on your dashboard or in a "My Courses" section.

Check the Schedule or Calendar: Look for a section on the platform that provides a schedule or calendar for the course. This could be labeled as "Schedule," "Calendar," or something similar.

View Upcoming Lessons: Access the schedule or calendar to view the upcoming lessons for your course. The information should include dates, times, and topics covered in each lesson.

Review Course Materials:** In addition to the schedule, check for any course materials, announcements, or notifications that might provide details about upcoming lessons.

Contact Instructor or Support:** If you have trouble finding information about upcoming lessons, consider reaching out to your course instructor or Educify's support team for assistance. Instructors may provide additional guidance on accessing the schedule or receiving notifications.

Set Notifications (if available): Some platforms allow you to set notifications for upcoming lessons. Check if there are options to receive reminders or alerts for upcoming class sessions.

Keep in mind that the specific steps and features can vary based on the Educify platform and the course design. If there have been updates or changes to Educify's features since my last knowledge update in January 2022, refer to the platform's official documentation or contact their support for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
