4. Why we use your information
We only use your personal information for the reasons below and only when the law allows us:
* To create and manage your account.
* To verify responders' identity and vehicles before they can accept jobs.
* To verify the car you want towed (even if it is not yours) so the right truck is dispatched.
* To connect you with the closest qualified responder (ambulance, fire truck, tow truck, security).
* To share critical health data with medics or firefighters so they know what to do.
* To process payments for services or Safety Market products.
* To send SMS or push notifications about your request (ETA, arrival, delivery).
* To alert your emergency contacts during an incident.
* To investigate complaints, prevent fraud and keep the platform safe.
* To improve the App (for example, fixing bugs or adding new features).
* To send you safety tips or promotional messages if you opt in.
* To obey court orders or requests from law enforcement (for example, sharing incident photos with the Police or FRSC when legally required).

* Consent: for marketing messages, storing health data, or sharing photos beyond the basic service.
* Contract: to open your account and provide the services you request.
* Legal obligation: to keep tax records or respond to a lawful request.
