The possibility of scheduling lessons every other week on Educify depends on the specific features and options offered by the platform, as well as the policies set by the course instructor. Here are general steps you might consider:

Contact Instructor: If you're unable to find a self-service option for adjusting lesson frequency, consider reaching out to your course instructor. Instructors often have flexibility in how they structure their courses.

Review Course Policies:** Check the course policies or syllabus for any guidelines related to lesson frequency. The instructor may have specified the expected schedule.

Explore Communication Channels:** Some platforms and courses use communication channels like discussion forums or messaging systems for scheduling-related discussions. Explore these channels for any guidance.

Use Any Provided Tools:** If Educify provides scheduling tools or calendars, use them to manage your lesson schedule. Look for options to customize the frequency of lessons.

Remember that the ability to have lessons every other week may vary depending on the course format and the preferences of the instructor. It's essential to communicate with the instructor and adhere to any guidelines or policies set for the course.
