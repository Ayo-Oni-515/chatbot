What age groups can you teach?
What grade should I teach? 

Choose grade levels based on your skill level, subject area expertise, career goals, and personal attributes. Answer key questions to determine the best fit for your teaching position.

For example, Do you work better with younger students or more mature learners? 

Consider your temperament to guide your interactions with students. If you enjoy spontaneity and nurturing, lower elementary grades may be suitable. If you prefer instructing older students in more in-depth lessons, teen grades might be a better fit. Teen teachers often value spontaneity and character growth in preteens.

Another way to help you determine the best grade level to instruct is by focusing on what subjects and types of learning you feel are most important. For example, if you desire to teach percussion instruments and have a passion for large musical productions, teens may be the best choice for a grade level.
